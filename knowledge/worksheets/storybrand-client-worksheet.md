## About This Worksheet

The StoryBrand framework, created by Donald Miller, uses the power of story to clarify your marketing message. In every great story:

- **Your customer is the HERO** (not your brand)
- **Your brand is the GUIDE** (like Yoda to Luke, or Haymitch to Katniss)
- **You give them a PLAN** that leads to success
- **There are STAKES** if they don't take action

Answer each question thoughtfully. There are no wrong answers - we're capturing the essence of your business and the transformation you create.

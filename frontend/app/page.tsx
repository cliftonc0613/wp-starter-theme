 * StoryBrand Homepage
 *
 * This homepage follows the StoryBrand 7-part framework by Donald Miller.
 * The structure positions your CUSTOMER as the hero, and your BRAND as the guide.
 *
 * Section Order:
 * 1. Hero - Pass the "grunt test" (what you offer, how it helps, how to get it)
 * 2. Problem - Agitate the pain points (external, internal, philosophical)
 * 3. Value Stack - Show the benefits/transformation (or use WordPress Services)
 * 4. Guide - Position your brand as the trusted guide (empathy + authority)
 * 5. Plan - 3 simple steps to success
 * 6. Explanatory Paragraph - Problem → Solution → Success narrative
 * 7. Lead Capture - Free consultation/resource for those not ready to buy
 * 8. Stakes - What happens if they don't act
 * 9. Social Proof - Testimonials and client logos (WordPress Testimonials)
 * 10. Blog - Optional content section (WordPress Posts)
 * 11. Final CTA - Close with strong call to action
 *
 * To customize: Replace [PLACEHOLDER] text in each component with real content.

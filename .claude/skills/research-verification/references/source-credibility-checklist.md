# Source Credibility Checklist

This reference provides detailed criteria for evaluating source credibility, identifying bias indicators, and assessing methodological rigor during research verification.

## Evaluating Author Credentials

### Academic Credentials
- **PhD or Terminal Degree**: Highest level of expertise in the field
- **Master's Degree**: Advanced knowledge, credible for applied topics
- **Bachelor's Degree**: Basic credentialing, less authoritative
- **No Listed Credentials**: Requires additional verification through professional experience

### Institutional Affiliation
- **Tier 1 Universities/Research Institutions**: High credibility (MIT, Stanford, Harvard, etc.)
- **Government Research Agencies**: High credibility (NIH, NSF, USGS, etc.)
- **Professional Associations**: Moderate credibility (depends on field standards)
- **Think Tanks**: Variable credibility (check funding sources and ideological lean)
- **Corporate Research**: Moderate to low credibility (check for conflicts of interest)
- **Independent/Unaffiliated**: Low credibility unless verified track record

### Publication Track Record
- **Highly Cited**: 500+ citations on Google Scholar (high authority)
- **Moderately Cited**: 50-500 citations (established expertise)
- **Emerging Scholar**: 10-50 citations (credible but less established)
- **Uncited**: 0-10 citations (verify through other credentials)

### Professional Experience
- **10+ Years in Field**: High credibility if relevant to topic
- **5-10 Years in Field**: Moderate credibility
- **< 5 Years in Field**: Lower credibility, check other credentials
- **Industry Experience**: Credible for applied topics, less so for academic research

## Identifying Source Types

### Primary Sources - Indicators
- Contains a "Methodology" or "Methods" section
- Presents original data, surveys, or experiments
- Includes statistical analysis of collected data
- First-hand accounts or direct observation
- Peer-reviewed empirical studies
- Government datasets or official reports
- Original documents (laws, policies, court cases)

### Secondary Analysis - Indicators
- Reviews or synthesizes existing research
- Meta-analysis combining multiple studies
- Literature review sections
- Comparative analysis across sources
- Expert interpretation without new data collection
- Textbooks or encyclopedic entries
- Systematic reviews

### Opinion Pieces - Indicators
- Editorial or op-ed designation
- First-person language ("I believe," "In my opinion")
- Persuasive or advocacy tone
- Lacks systematic methodology
- Published in opinion sections of outlets
- Lacks peer review
- Subjective interpretation presented as fact

## Bias Indicators and Red Flags

### Ideological Bias Indicators
- **Politically Charged Language**: Excessive use of partisan terminology
- **One-Sided Framing**: Presents only arguments supporting one viewpoint
- **Strawman Arguments**: Misrepresents opposing views
- **Selective Evidence**: Cherry-picks data supporting predetermined conclusion
- **Emotional Appeals**: Relies on fear, anger, or outrage rather than evidence

### Funding and Conflict of Interest
- **Corporate Funding**: Research funded by industry with vested interest in outcomes
- **Political Funding**: Research funded by advocacy groups or political organizations
- **Institutional Bias**: University or think tank with known ideological position
- **Undisclosed Funding**: Source does not disclose who funded the research (major red flag)
- **Author Employment**: Author employed by organization that benefits from research findings

### Methodological Bias Indicators
- **Small Sample Sizes**: Insufficient data for generalizable conclusions
- **Non-Random Sampling**: Convenience sampling or self-selection bias
- **Lack of Control Groups**: Experimental design without proper controls
- **Confounding Variables**: Failure to account for alternative explanations
- **P-Hacking**: Statistical manipulation to achieve desired results
- **Unreproducible Results**: Study has not been replicated successfully

### Publication Venue Bias
- **Predatory Journals**: Pay-to-publish outlets with no peer review
- **Low-Impact Journals**: Minimal citation impact or academic credibility
- **Non-Peer-Reviewed**: Published without expert review
- **Self-Published**: No editorial oversight or quality control
- **Blog or Social Media**: Not a credible publication venue for research

## Assessing Methodological Rigor

### Quantitative Research Quality
- **Sample Size**: Adequate N for statistical power (generally 30+ for basic stats)
- **Random Sampling**: Probability-based selection methods
- **Control Groups**: Proper experimental controls
- **Statistical Significance**: p-values reported and appropriate
- **Effect Sizes**: Practical significance reported, not just statistical
- **Replication**: Study has been replicated or is part of established literature

### Qualitative Research Quality
- **Triangulation**: Multiple data sources or methods
- **Rich Description**: Detailed contextual information
- **Reflexivity**: Researcher acknowledges their biases and positionality
- **Saturation**: Data collection continued until patterns stabilized
- **Member Checking**: Participants validated interpretations
- **Audit Trail**: Clear documentation of research process

### Mixed Methods Quality
- **Integration**: Clear connection between qualitative and quantitative components
- **Complementarity**: Methods complement rather than contradict each other
- **Sequencing**: Logical order of methods (exploratory → confirmatory, or vice versa)
- **Equal Rigor**: Both components meet quality standards

## Citation Network Red Flags

### Circular Citations
- **Mutual Citation**: Sources A and B cite only each other
- **Citation Rings**: Small group of sources cite each other exclusively
- **Self-Citation Excess**: Author cites primarily their own work
- **No External Validation**: Sources lack citations from outside the immediate network

### Authority Over-Reliance
- **Single Source Dependency**: Most sources cite one foundational source
- **Outdated Foundation**: Core citations are 10+ years old in rapidly evolving fields
- **Geographic Concentration**: All sources from same institution/region
- **Methodological Monoculture**: All sources use identical methods

### Orphaned Sources
- **Zero Internal Citations**: High-quality source not cited by any other source in collection
- **Zero External Citations**: Source has no citations on Google Scholar or academic databases
- **Isolated Findings**: Source presents findings contradicting all other sources without explanation

## Publication Currency Standards

### Rapidly Evolving Fields (Technology, Medicine, Current Events)
- **Optimal**: Published within last 2 years
- **Acceptable**: Published within last 5 years
- **Outdated**: Published 5+ years ago (use with caution)

### Moderately Evolving Fields (Social Sciences, Business, Education)
- **Optimal**: Published within last 5 years
- **Acceptable**: Published within last 10 years
- **Outdated**: Published 10+ years ago (use with caution)

### Slowly Evolving Fields (History, Philosophy, Foundational Sciences)
- **Optimal**: Classic works remain relevant regardless of age
- **Acceptable**: 20+ year-old sources acceptable for foundational concepts
- **Outdated**: Depends on topic - verify current relevance

## Overall Credibility Scoring

Use this rubric to assign an overall credibility rating:

### High Credibility
- Majority of sources are primary or secondary analysis (≥70%)
- Authors have verified expert credentials (≥80%)
- Sources published within appropriate timeframe for field
- Diverse perspectives represented
- Minimal bias indicators
- Healthy citation network (no circular citations, diverse authorities)
- Rigorous methodology across sources

### Moderate Credibility
- Mixed source types (50-70% primary/secondary)
- Most authors have credentials (60-80%)
- Some outdated sources but mostly current
- Limited perspective diversity
- Some bias indicators present
- Citation network has minor issues (some over-reliance)
- Methodological rigor varies

### Low Credibility
- Majority opinion pieces or unverified sources (>50%)
- Few authors with credentials (<60%)
- Predominantly outdated sources
- Echo chamber - single perspective
- Multiple bias indicators
- Citation network problems (circular citations, single-source dependency)
- Weak or absent methodology

## Perspective Diversity Checklist

Ensure research includes diverse perspectives across:

- **Geographic Diversity**: Sources from multiple countries/regions
- **Ideological Diversity**: Multiple viewpoints represented (conservative, liberal, centrist, etc.)
- **Methodological Diversity**: Mix of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods
- **Source Type Diversity**: Balance of primary, secondary, and (limited) opinion
- **Institutional Diversity**: Sources from academia, government, industry, NGOs
- **Temporal Diversity**: Mix of recent and foundational sources
- **Stakeholder Diversity**: Perspectives from all affected parties (not just beneficiaries)

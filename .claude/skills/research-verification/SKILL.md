# Research Verification

## Overview

This skill provides a systematic framework for double-checking research quality by evaluating source credibility, diversity, and citation patterns. It guides the verification process through three critical analytical questions that reveal source reliability, perspective bias, and academic authority.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Research has been gathered and needs quality verification before finalizing
- Creating content that requires credible, diverse sources (blog posts, reports, articles, academic papers)
- Evaluating whether research sources meet publication or editorial standards
- Checking for echo chambers, bias bubbles, or insufficient source diversity
- Preparing research for peer review or editorial scrutiny
- Assessing the credibility of sources for market research, competitive analysis, or strategic reports

## Source Evaluation Workflow

The research verification process follows three sequential questions that build upon each other to create a comprehensive source quality assessment. Each question should be completed in order, as later questions rely on insights from earlier ones.

### Question 1: Source Documentation Table

Create a comprehensive table documenting each source with the following columns:

**Required Columns:**
1. **Source Title/Name** - Full title of article, report, or publication
2. **Publication Date** - When the source was published (critical for currency and relevance)
3. **Author Credentials** - Author's qualifications, expertise, institutional affiliation, or professional background
4. **Source Type** - Categorize as one of the following:
   - **Primary Source**: Original research, first-hand accounts, raw data, empirical studies, original documents
   - **Secondary Analysis**: Analysis or interpretation of primary sources, literature reviews, meta-analyses, synthesized research
   - **Opinion Piece**: Editorial content, commentary, perspective pieces, advocacy writing

**Source Type Evaluation Criteria:**

*Primary Sources* are identified by:
- Original research methodology sections
- First-hand data collection or observation
- Peer-reviewed empirical studies
- Official documents, reports, or datasets
- Direct interviews or original surveys

*Secondary Analysis* is identified by:
- Literature reviews or meta-analyses
- Synthesis of multiple primary sources
- Academic analysis of existing research
- Comparative studies across sources
- Expert interpretation of data

*Opinion Pieces* are identified by:
- Editorial or commentary sections
- First-person perspective ("I believe," "In my view")
- Advocacy or persuasive language
- Lack of systematic methodology
- Subjective interpretation without empirical support

**Author Credentials Evaluation:**

For each source, document:
- Academic degrees and institutional affiliations
- Professional experience relevant to the topic
- Published track record or citation count
- Industry credentials or certifications
- "Unknown" if credentials cannot be verified

**Table Format Example:**

```
| Source Title | Publication Date | Author Credentials | Source Type |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Climate Impact Study 2024 | Jan 2024 | Dr. Jane Smith, PhD Environmental Science, MIT | Primary Source |
| Review of Climate Literature | Mar 2024 | Prof. John Doe, Published 50+ papers, Stanford | Secondary Analysis |
| Why Climate Action Matters | Feb 2024 | Sarah Johnson, Climate Activist, No academic credentials listed | Opinion Piece |
```

After creating the table, provide a **Source Distribution Summary**:
- Total number of sources
- Breakdown by source type (X primary, Y secondary, Z opinion)
- Percentage of sources with verified expert credentials
- Date range of sources (oldest to newest)
- Any concerning patterns (e.g., too many opinion pieces, outdated sources, lack of primary research)

### Question 2: Bias and Perspective Analysis

Analyze the top five most substantial sources to identify perspective patterns and potential bias. "Substantial" sources are determined by:
- Length and depth of analysis
- Citation count or academic impact
- Institutional credibility
- Comprehensiveness of data or argumentation

**For each of the top five sources, summarize:**

1. **Primary Perspective** - What viewpoint or position does this source advocate?
2. **Ideological Lean** - Does the source lean toward a particular ideology, industry position, or advocacy stance?
3. **Funding/Affiliation** - Who funded the research or employs the author? (Conflicts of interest)
4. **Methodological Approach** - What methods did they use? (Qualitative, quantitative, mixed, anecdotal)
5. **Framing** - How does the source frame the issue? (Problem-focused, solution-focused, neutral analysis)

**After individual source analysis, provide:**

**Perspective Diversity Assessment:**
- Do sources represent multiple viewpoints, or do they echo similar perspectives?
- Are there gaps in perspective coverage? (e.g., all sources from one industry, region, or ideological position)
- Is there balance between advocacy and neutral analysis?
- Are dissenting or alternative viewpoints represented?

**Bias Risk Summary:**
- Identify any echo chamber risks (sources citing each other without external validation)
- Note any potential conflicts of interest or funding bias
- Highlight methodological limitations that could introduce bias
- Flag any sources that present opinion as fact

**Format Example:**

```
**Source 1: Climate Impact Study 2024**
- Primary Perspective: Urgent climate action needed based on empirical temperature data
- Ideological Lean: Environmental advocacy, data-driven
- Funding/Affiliation: National Science Foundation grant, MIT affiliation
- Methodological Approach: Quantitative analysis of 50-year temperature datasets
- Framing: Problem-focused with proposed solutions

**Perspective Diversity Assessment:**
All five sources advocate for climate action with minor variations in urgency and proposed solutions. Missing: economic impact analysis from industry perspective, alternative climate theories, developing nation perspectives.

**Bias Risk Summary:**
Moderate echo chamber risk - four of five sources cite each other. All sources funded by environmental or government science agencies. No apparent conflicts of interest, but lack of industry or economic counterpoints limits perspective diversity.
```

### Question 3: Citation Network Analysis

Identify which sources are most frequently cited or referenced by other sources to understand the research's authority structure and intellectual lineage.

**Analysis Steps:**

1. **Cross-Reference Citations** - For each source in the research, note which other sources in the collection cite or reference it
2. **Citation Frequency Count** - Count how many times each source is cited by others in the collection
3. **External Citation Check** - If possible, check external citation counts (Google Scholar, academic databases)
4. **Authority Identification** - Identify which sources serve as foundational or authoritative references

**Output Format:**

Create a **Citation Network Summary**:

```
**Most Cited Sources (Internal to Research Collection):**
1. Climate Impact Study 2024 - Cited by 8 other sources in collection
2. IPCC Report 2023 - Cited by 6 other sources in collection
3. Temperature Analysis Methods - Cited by 4 other sources in collection

**External Citation Metrics (if available):**
- Climate Impact Study 2024: 450 citations on Google Scholar
- IPCC Report 2023: 12,000+ citations on Google Scholar

**Authority Structure:**
The research relies heavily on Climate Impact Study 2024 and IPCC Report 2023 as foundational sources. All secondary sources derive their data from these two primary sources. This creates a dependency chain - if these foundational sources have methodological issues, all dependent sources inherit those limitations.

**Citation Network Concerns:**
- Over-reliance on single foundational source (Climate Impact Study 2024)
- Limited citation diversity - most sources cite the same 2-3 authorities
- Circular citation pattern detected: Sources A, B, and C cite each other without external validation
```

**Red Flags to Identify:**

- **Circular Citations**: Sources citing each other without external validation
- **Over-Reliance**: Single source cited by majority of other sources (single point of failure)
- **Orphaned Sources**: High-quality sources not cited by anyone (potential hidden gems or irrelevant outliers)
- **Low External Citations**: Sources with zero citations outside the collection may lack peer validation
- **Citation Recency**: Are the most-cited sources recent, or is research built on outdated foundations?

## Final Research Quality Report

After completing all three questions, synthesize findings into a **Research Quality Summary**:

**Strengths:**
- What does this research do well? (e.g., strong primary sources, diverse perspectives, authoritative citations)

**Weaknesses:**
- What are the gaps or limitations? (e.g., bias toward one perspective, outdated sources, circular citations)

**Recommendations:**
- What additional sources should be added to improve quality?
- Which sources should be reconsidered or removed?
- How can perspective diversity be improved?

**Overall Credibility Rating:**
Provide a qualitative rating (High, Moderate, Low) with justification based on:
- Source type distribution (primary vs. secondary vs. opinion)
- Author credential verification rate
- Perspective diversity
- Citation network health
- Publication currency

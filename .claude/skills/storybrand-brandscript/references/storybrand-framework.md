# StoryBrand Framework Reference

*This document contains the complete StoryBrand 7-part framework by Donald Miller, adapted for website copy generation.*

## The Core Principle

**Your customer is the hero of the story, not your brand.**

In every great story, a hero wants something, encounters a problem, meets a guide who gives them a plan, calls them to action, helps them avoid failure, and leads them to success.

Your website should follow this same narrative structure.

## The 7 Elements of StoryBrand

### 1. A Character (The Hero = Your Customer)

The story starts with a character who wants something. This is NOT your company - it's your customer.

**Key Questions:**
- Who is your customer?
- What do they want?
- What transformation are they seeking?

**Copy Principle:** The headline should focus on what the CUSTOMER wants to become or achieve, not what you do.

**Good Example:** "Become the Leader Your Team Needs"
**Bad Example:** "We Provide Leadership Training"

---

### 2. Has a Problem

Every hero faces a problem that stands between them and what they want. In StoryBrand, we identify THREE types of problems:

#### External Problem
The tangible, surface-level challenge they face. This is what they'd describe to a friend.

*Example: "I can't get enough leads from my website."*

#### Internal Problem
How the external problem makes them FEEL. This is the emotional undercurrent.

*Example: "I feel embarrassed that our website looks unprofessional."*

#### Philosophical Problem
Why this situation is fundamentally WRONG. This connects to a larger sense of justice.

*Example: "Great businesses shouldn't struggle to be found online."*

#### The Villain (Root Cause)
Behind every problem is a villain - the single root cause that creates all the symptoms. Naming the villain:
- Creates a common enemy between you and the customer
- Focuses the narrative on defeating something specific
- Makes your solution the "weapon" against the villain
- Gives the customer someone/something to blame (that isn't themselves)

*Example: "Outdated technology" is the villain causing slow processes, frustrated teams, and lost opportunities.*

*More villain examples:*
- "Information overload" - causing confusion and paralysis
- "Time scarcity" - forcing rushed decisions and missed opportunities
- "Confusing regulations" - creating compliance anxiety and wasted resources
- "Poor communication" - leading to misunderstandings and failed projects

**Copy Principle:** Name the villain explicitly. Position your solution as the weapon that defeats it.

**Copy Principle:** Address all three problem levels. The internal problem is often the most powerful motivator.

---

### 3. And Meets a Guide

This is where YOUR brand enters the story - not as the hero, but as the GUIDE.

Think: Yoda to Luke, Haymitch to Katniss, Gandalf to Frodo.

A good guide demonstrates two things:

#### Empathy
"We understand what you're going through."

Shows you've walked in their shoes and understand their struggle.

*Example: "We know how frustrating it is to watch competitors get all the attention while you struggle to be found."*

#### Authority
"We have the experience to help you succeed."

Provides credentials, results, and proof that you can actually help.

*Example: "We've helped over 500 businesses increase their leads by an average of 300%."*

**Copy Principle:** Lead with empathy, then establish authority. Too much authority without empathy feels arrogant.

---

### 4. Who Gives Them a Plan

The guide gives the hero a clear path forward. This reduces confusion and makes the next steps feel simple.

**The 3-Step Plan:**
Even if your process is complex, distill it to 3 steps:

1. **Action Step** - What they DO first (schedule, sign up, contact)
2. **Process Step** - What YOU do (create, build, analyze)
3. **Result Step** - The VICTORY they achieve (grow, succeed, transform)

*Example:*
1. Schedule a Free Consultation
2. We Create Your Custom Strategy
3. Watch Your Business Grow

**Copy Principle:** Use verbs. Make each step feel achievable. Always end with success.

#### The Agreement Plan (Alternative)
If your 3-step process doesn't naturally fit, or you want to build additional trust, use an Agreement Plan instead (or in addition). This addresses objections directly:

- List 3-5 guarantees or commitments
- Address specific fears and objections raised by prospects
- Build trust through promises you can keep
- Alleviate the risk of working with you

*Example agreements:*
- "Same-day response guarantee"
- "No hidden fees - ever"
- "100% satisfaction or your money back"
- "Clear communication at every step"
- "No long-term contracts required"

**When to use Agreement Plan:**
- When prospects have strong objections or fears
- When trust is a major barrier to conversion
- When your process is complex and a 3-step plan oversimplifies
- When you have strong guarantees that differentiate you

**Copy Principle:** Make bold promises you can actually keep. Specificity builds credibility.

---

### 5. And Calls Them to Action

The hero needs to be challenged to take action. Without a clear CTA, they won't move.

#### Direct CTA
The primary action that leads to purchase or conversion.

*Examples: "Get a Free Quote", "Schedule Your Call", "Start Your Free Trial"*

#### Transitional CTA
For those not ready to commit. Captures leads for nurturing.

*Examples: "Download Free Guide", "Watch Demo", "Take the Assessment"*

**Copy Principle:**
- Direct CTAs should be prominent, repeated, and specific
- Transitional CTAs should offer genuine value
- Both should be visible without scrolling

---

### 6. That Helps Them Avoid Failure

Every story needs stakes. Without risk, there's no urgency.

**What's at stake if they don't act?**

*Examples:*
- Lost revenue and missed opportunities
- Wasted time on ineffective approaches
- Falling further behind competitors
- The problem getting worse over time

**Copy Principle:** Don't be manipulative or fear-mongering. Be honest about real consequences. Frame as "what you're missing" not "what terrible thing will happen."

---

### 7. And Ends in Success

Paint the picture of what life looks like when they succeed.

**The Transformation:**
- Before: Struggling, confused, frustrated
- After: Thriving, clear, confident

**Copy Principle:** Be specific about outcomes. Use their language. Show the emotional transformation, not just practical results.

*Example: "Stop chasing leads and start closing deals. Our clients report spending 50% less time on marketing while doubling their qualified leads."*

---

## The StoryBrand One-Liner

A concise statement that captures your entire value proposition:

**Formula:** [Problem] + [Solution] + [Result]

*Example: "Most small businesses struggle to stand out online. We create websites that attract and convert your ideal customers. The result? A steady stream of qualified leads that grow your business."*

## Website Section Mapping

Here's how the StoryBrand elements map to homepage sections:

| Character + Desire | Hero Section | Pass the "grunt test" |
| Problem | Problem Section | Agitate pain points |
| Guide (Empathy + Authority) | Guide Section | Build trust |
| Plan | Plan Steps | Make it feel simple |
| Call to Action | CTAs (throughout) | Drive conversion |
| Success | Value Stack, Testimonials | Show transformation |
| Failure | Stakes Section | Create urgency |

# YouTube Content Generator

Generate professional YouTube video content including scripts, descriptions, b-roll recommendations, and thumbnail suggestions in separate files ready for production.

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Video Information

When invoked, ask the user the following questions in order to understand their video needs:

1. **Target Audience & Topic**: What's the main topic or niche for your YouTube video? (e.g., AI education, product reviews, tutorials, vlogs)
2. **Video Style & Tone**: What's your preferred tone? (e.g., educational, entertaining, motivational, conversational, formal)
3. **Video Length**: Are you targeting short-form (under 5 mins), medium (5-15 mins), or longer videos?
4. **Brand/Visual Identity**: Do you have specific brand colors, logos, or visual guidelines? Include company/organization name if applicable.
5. **Content Structure**: Do you want a specific format? (e.g., problem-solution, tutorial, storytelling, interview format)
6. **B-roll Specifics**: What types of b-roll footage should I suggest? (e.g., screen recordings, real-world footage, animations, stock footage categories)
7. **Output Frequency**: Are you planning single videos or series? Any other context about the video's purpose?

Collect all responses before proceeding to generate content.

### 2. Generate Content Files

Based on the user's responses, create four separate files:

#### YouTube Script (`youtube_script.md`)
- **Hook** (5-10 seconds): Compelling opening line
- **Value Preview** (10-15 seconds): What the viewer will learn/gain
- **Main Content**: Structured by sections with timing cues
- **Call-to-Action**: Clear next steps (subscribe, visit link, etc.)
- **Outro**: Channel branding and related videos
- **Total word count**: Note approximate video length

Include:
- Speaker cues (PAUSE, EMPHASIS, SLOW DOWN)
- Timing indicators for each section
- Natural conversational language
- Engagement hooks throughout

#### Video Description (`video_description.md`)
- **Hook line**: First 2-3 sentences with keywords
- **Full description**: 200-500 words
- **Timestamps**: If applicable
- **Links section**: CTA links, website, social media
- **Hashtags**: 5-10 relevant hashtags
- **SEO optimization**: Keywords naturally woven in

#### B-Roll Shot List (`broll_suggestions.md`)
- **Scene-by-scene breakdown**: Matches script sections
- **Shot descriptions**: Duration, type, mood/tone for each shot
- **Content source suggestions**: Where to find/create footage
- **Transitions**: Notes on how shots should connect
- **Stock footage keywords**: For quick sourcing
- **Custom creation notes**: If specific footage needs filming

#### Thumbnail Concepts (`thumbnail_suggestions.md`)
- **Design Concept 1**: Description with specific elements, colors, fonts
- **Design Concept 2**: Alternative approach
- **Design Concept 3**: Optional third variation
- **Key elements to include**: Text, imagery, branding guidelines
- **Color palette**: Based on brand identity
- **Typography**: Font recommendations
- **Accessibility notes**: Readability at small sizes

### 3. File Output Format

All files should be created as markdown (.md) files with:
- Clear headings and sections
- Ready-to-use content (not just outlines)
- Practical, production-ready recommendations
- Timing and technical specifications where relevant

## Tips for Quality Output

- Match the tone and style throughout all four files
- Ensure script length aligns with target video duration
- Make thumbnail suggestions contrast well and remain readable at small sizes
- Suggest b-roll that complements rather than distracts from the message
- Include specific, actionable recommendations (not vague suggestions)

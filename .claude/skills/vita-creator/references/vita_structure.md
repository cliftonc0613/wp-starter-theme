# Vita Structure & Formatting Guide

## Overview

A curriculum vitae (CV) is a comprehensive document that lists all professional and academic accomplishments. Unlike a resume, a vita is exhaustive and can be 2-10+ pages depending on career length and achievements.

## Standard Vita Sections

### Header

jane.smith@university.edu | (555) 123-4567
```

### Professional Summary (Optional)
Brief 2-3 sentence statement of professional expertise, research interests, or career focus. More common in academic/research vitas.

**Example:**
"Environmental scientist with 15+ years of experience in climate policy and sustainability research. Specializing in carbon sequestration and renewable energy systems with focus on developing scalable solutions for policy makers."

4. **Quantify**: Include numbers where they strengthen your case (grants secured, students mentored, publications, growth metrics)
5. **Section Titles**: Use bold or capital letters to distinguish sections
6. **Whitespace**: Adequate spacing makes the vita easier to scan
7. **Length**: Academic vitas can be longer (5-10+ pages is normal); industry vitas may be 2-4 pages

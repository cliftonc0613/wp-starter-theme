# Project Proposal Generator

Generate professional, comprehensive project proposals that clearly communicate value, scope, timeline, budget, and deliverables to stakeholders and clients.

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Project Information

When invoked, ask the user the following questions to understand the project requirements:

1. **Project Overview**: What is the project name and high-level objective? What problem does it solve?
2. **Client/Stakeholder**: Who is the proposal for? (client name, internal stakeholder, department)
3. **Project Type**: What type of project is this? (e.g., web development, consulting, marketing campaign, infrastructure upgrade, product development)
4. **Scope Details**: What are the key deliverables and features? What's included and what's explicitly excluded?
5. **Timeline Constraints**: What's the desired timeline or deadline? Are there any critical milestones or dependencies?
6. **Budget Range**: What's the estimated budget or budget range? Should this include a breakdown by phase or deliverable?
7. **Team & Resources**: Who will be involved? (team size, roles, external vendors, required expertise)
8. **Success Metrics**: How will success be measured? What are the key performance indicators (KPIs)?
9. **Risks & Assumptions**: Are there any known risks, dependencies, or assumptions to document?
10. **Additional Context**: Any competitive context, previous attempts, or special requirements?

Collect all responses before proceeding to generate the proposal.

### 2. Generate Proposal Document

Based on the user's responses, create a comprehensive proposal file:

#### Project Proposal (`project_proposal.md`)

The proposal should include the following sections:

##### Executive Summary
- Project name and overview (2-3 sentences)
- Core problem being solved
- Proposed solution summary
- Expected outcomes and value proposition
- Total investment and timeline at a glance

##### Background & Context
- Current situation analysis
- Problem statement with impact
- Opportunity description
- Alignment with business goals/strategy

##### Project Objectives
- Primary objective
- Secondary objectives (3-5 bullet points)
- Success criteria and KPIs
- Expected ROI or value metrics

##### Scope of Work
- **In Scope**: Detailed list of what will be delivered
  - Organized by phases or workstreams
  - Specific features, components, or activities
- **Out of Scope**: Explicitly state what's not included
- **Assumptions**: Key assumptions the proposal is based on
- **Dependencies**: External factors or prerequisites

##### Deliverables
- Comprehensive list of all deliverables
- Format: Deliverable name, description, acceptance criteria
- Organized by phase or category
- Include both tangible outputs and intangible outcomes

##### Project Timeline
- Overall project duration
- Key phases with timeframes
- Major milestones with dates
- Critical path items
- Buffer time for reviews and revisions
- Format as a table or Gantt-style breakdown

##### Budget & Investment
- Total project cost (summary)
- Breakdown by:
  - Phase or deliverable
  - Resource type (labor, tools, licenses, etc.)
  - Cost category (development, design, testing, etc.)
- Payment schedule/milestones
- Optional: Tiered pricing options (if applicable)

##### Team & Resources
- Project team structure
- Key roles and responsibilities
- Required expertise and qualifications
- External vendors or partners (if applicable)
- Client/stakeholder responsibilities

##### Methodology & Approach
- Project management methodology (Agile, Waterfall, hybrid)
- Development/execution approach
- Communication plan and cadence
- Quality assurance process
- Change management process

##### Risk Assessment & Mitigation
- Identified risks (technical, timeline, budget, resource)
- Risk level (High/Medium/Low)
- Mitigation strategies for each risk
- Contingency plans

##### Terms & Conditions
- Payment terms
- Intellectual property ownership
- Confidentiality requirements
- Termination clauses
- Warranty or support period (if applicable)

##### Next Steps
- Proposal acceptance process
- Contract signing timeline
- Project kickoff date
- Immediate action items
- Contact information for questions

##### Appendices (Optional)
- Technical specifications
- Case studies or portfolio examples
- Team member bios
- Detailed technical architecture
- Additional supporting documentation

### 3. File Output Format

The proposal should be created as a markdown (.md) file with:
- Professional formatting with clear hierarchy
- Tables for budget, timeline, and deliverables
- Consistent styling throughout
- Ready to convert to PDF or present directly
- Client/stakeholder-friendly language (avoid jargon unless necessary)

### 4. Optional Supplementary Files

Depending on project complexity, consider creating additional files:

#### Budget Breakdown (`budget_breakdown.md`)
- Detailed cost breakdown with formulas
- Assumptions for cost calculations
- Alternative pricing scenarios

#### Project Timeline (`project_timeline.md`)
- Detailed Gantt chart or timeline
- Task dependencies
- Resource allocation by phase

#### Technical Specifications (`technical_specs.md`)
- Detailed technical requirements
- Architecture diagrams (described)
- Technology stack details
- Integration requirements

## Tips for Quality Output

- **Be specific**: Use concrete numbers, dates, and deliverables rather than vague statements
- **Show value**: Clearly articulate ROI and business impact throughout
- **Manage expectations**: Be realistic with timelines and scope; under-promise and over-deliver
- **Address concerns proactively**: Include risk mitigation to build confidence
- **Use professional language**: Balance technical accuracy with accessibility
- **Make it scannable**: Use headers, bullet points, and tables for easy navigation
- **Include visuals**: Describe where charts, diagrams, or mockups would enhance understanding
- **Customize tone**: Match the formality level to the audience (corporate vs. startup, internal vs. external)
- **Highlight differentiators**: What makes this approach unique or superior?
- **Call to action**: Make next steps crystal clear

## Example Use Cases

- **Web Development**: E-commerce site rebuild with timeline, tech stack, and phased delivery
- **Consulting**: Digital transformation roadmap with workshops, assessments, and implementation
- **Marketing**: Campaign proposal with creative concepts, media plan, and performance metrics
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud migration with security assessment, migration phases, and cost optimization
- **Product Development**: New feature development with user research, design, development, and launch phases

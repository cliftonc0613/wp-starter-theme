## TROUBLESHOOTING THE TROUBLESHOOTING

**"What if my students already know ChatGPT?"**
→ Great! They'll move faster. Ask them to make their prompts MORE sophisticated.

**"What if I'm running late on prompts?"**
→ Skip Prompt 5 if you must. Better to complete 4 well than rush 5 badly.

**"What if internet dies?"**
→ Show pre-recorded AI responses from your laptop. Students still see what's possible.

**"What if students say it's too easy?"**
→ Challenge them: "Make your prompt so specific that ONLY your desired outcome works."

**"What if students say it's too hard?"**
→ Remind them: "You're not supposed to be an expert. You're supposed to try. That's it."

---

## SUCCESS INDICATORS

**You'll know it worked if:**

✅ 90%+ attendance (students showed up, stayed, didn't leave early)

✅ 100% attempted all 5 prompts (everyone left with a completed artifact)

✅ Students asked questions (engaged, not passive)

✅ At least 1 "aha moment" per group (you heard: "Oh, I didn't know I could do that")

✅ Students said they could see themselves using AI (connection to their lives)

✅ High energy in Showcase (excitement, not awkwardness)

✅ Students returned for Session 1B (voted with their feet)

---

## CONTINGENCY PLANS

**If attendance is low (60-70%):**
→ Don't adjust pacing. Deliver the same session to the group that showed up.

**If attendance is high (25+ students):**
→ Consider adding a TA or having students work in larger pods.
→ Takes longer but maintains quality.

**If technical skill is lower than expected:**
→ Spend extra time on TEACH phase (add 10 minutes)
→ Simplify prompts by half (don't eliminate them)
→ Offer more hands-on support during BUILD

**If technical skill is higher than expected:**
→ Add an advanced challenge: "Make your prompt even better by asking a follow-up"
→ Compress BUILD phase (finish early, extend Showcase)
→ Use those students as peer mentors for others

## VIDEO RECOMMENDATIONS

**Before you teach, watch these to get inspired:**

1. **"What is AI?"** (3 min) - Any explainer video on YouTube that feels conversational
   - Why: Sets tone for casual, accessible explanation

2. **"ChatGPT in Action"** (3 min) - Show how ChatGPT creates something (email, code, etc.)
   - Why: Makes it real and concrete

3. **"Gen Z Learning TikTok"** (2 min) - Optional, shows how your students consume content
   - Why: Reminds you to keep it short, energetic, relevant

## INSTRUCTOR MINDSET RESET

Before you enter the classroom, read this:

**You are:**
- An enabler of possibility (not a gatekeeper of expertise)
- Someone who makes AI feel approachable
- A guide, not the expert
- Patient with questions
- Excited about what's possible

**You are NOT:**
- Required to know everything
- Trying to impress them with technical depth
- Responsible for their life trajectory
- Expected to solve everything

**Your job is simple:**
In 3 hours, show them: "You can work with AI. You can build real things. You belong here."

That's it. Do that, and you've succeeded.

---

## AFTER THIS SESSION

**What happens next?**

- Session 1B (Days 3-4): Data quality and why it matters
- Week 1 self-paced: 5 video modules reinforce concepts
- Week 2 onward: Students build ML models, train models, create solutions
- Week 8: They present their capstone project to potential employers

**Your Session 1A sets the tone for all of it.**

Make it good. Make it accessible. Make them feel capable.

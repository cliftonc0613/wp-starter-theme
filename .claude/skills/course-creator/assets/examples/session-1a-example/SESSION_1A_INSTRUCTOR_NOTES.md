---

## PHASE 1: TEACH (45 minutes)
### What is AI, Really?

**🎯 Goal:** Demystify AI so students feel capable (not overwhelmed)

---

### **0:00-0:10 | Welcome & Icebreaker (10 min)**

**ENERGY CHECK:** Start with energy. You set the tone.

**Script:**
"Welcome! I'm excited you're here. Before we jump in, let's get to know each other.

Poll: **Quick show of hands—who's here because:**
- A. You're curious about AI?
- B. You want better job prospects?
- C. You heard AI is the future?
- D. All of the above?

**Good news:** All of these are valid reasons, and we're covering all of it today.

Poll: **Who here has used ChatGPT before?**
- If yes: Great! We're going deeper.
- If no: Perfect! You're about to have your mind blown.

Let me give you 60 seconds of truth: **You don't need to be a programmer to learn AI.** You don't need advanced math. You need curiosity and willingness to try. That's it."

**KEY MESSAGE:** Confidence + Accessibility. Repeat if needed.

---

### **0:10-0:25 | "What is AI?" - 3-Minute Versions (15 min)**

**Show a 2-minute video** (pre-recorded or find on YouTube):
- ChatGPT writing an email
- DALL-E generating an image
- Netflix recommending a show
- **Why:** Concrete examples beat abstract definitions

**After video:**

**Script:**
"You just saw three types of AI:
1. **Generative AI** (ChatGPT) — creates new things
2. **Creative AI** (DALL-E) — makes images
3. **Predictive AI** (Netflix) — guesses what you want

But here's the KEY INSIGHT: They're all doing the SAME THING under the hood.

**What is AI, really?**

AI = **Machines learning patterns from data**

That's it. Not magic. Not some conspiracy. Patterns from data.

Example:
- Netflix saw **pattern:** People who watched Marvel watch more superhero content
- **Action:** Netflix recommends more superhero content to similar people
- **Result:** You think Netflix is psychic (it's not, it's patterns)

**Your Job in This Course:** Learn to work WITH these patterns, not against them."

**Draw on whiteboard (or screen share) simple diagram:**
```
Data → Machine Learns Patterns → Makes Predictions → Takes Action
```

---

### **0:25-0:35 | Three Types of AI (10 min)**

**Script:**
"Let's be specific about three types of AI you'll see everywhere:

**Type 1: Predictive AI** (your job prospects: GOOD)
- What it does: Guesses what comes next
- Examples: Netflix recommendations, Amazon product suggestions, your email spam filter
- Real job: Predictive Maintenance Specialist ($60-75K)
  - *'We predict when factory equipment fails BEFORE it breaks'*

**Type 2: Generative AI** (hottest skill right now)
- What it does: Creates new content (text, images, code, videos)
- Examples: ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney, Claude
- Real job: AI Content Strategist ($65-85K)
  - *'We use AI to create marketing content 10x faster'*

**Type 3: Generative AI for Analysis** (most valuable)
- What it does: Analyzes data and finds insights
- Examples: ChatGPT analyzing a dataset, Claude reviewing legal docs
- Real job: AI Business Analyst ($70-90K)
  - *'We use AI to find opportunities in data'*

**REALITY CHECK:** Most entry-level AI jobs combine all three. You'll learn all three."

---

### **0:35-0:45 | Career Stories (10 min)**

**Tell THREE specific stories (don't read, tell naturally):**

**Story 1: Marcus — From Warehouse to Predictive Maintenance**
"Marcus worked in a warehouse. He got laid off when the company automated. He took this course. Learned AI fundamentals. Now? He works for a manufacturing company predicting when equipment fails. His salary: $68K starting. Why? Because he understood the PROBLEM (equipment failing = loss of money) and learned AI to SOLVE it."

*Pause. Let it land.*

**Story 2: Sarah — From Sales to AI Sales Tools**
"Sarah was in sales for 10 years. Good at it, but burned out. She learned AI fundamentals in this course. Realized she could use AI to automate her lead qualifying. Now she runs an AI sales consulting practice helping other companies do the same. Her salary? $80K+ (and she's her own boss)."

**Story 3: Jamal — From Customer Service to AI Ethics**
"Jamal worked customer service. Dealt with terrible chatbots every day. Frustrated. Took this course. Realized he wanted to build BETTER AI. Now he works for a consulting firm helping companies think through AI ethics. His salary: $72K. His path: This course + extra study + his deep understanding of the problem."

**Script (ending):**
"Here's why I'm telling you these stories: **None of them started as programmers.** None had data science degrees. They all had real-world experience, learned AI fundamentals, and became valuable because they could TRANSLATE between the technology and the real problem.

**That's exactly what we're building toward in this course.**"

---

## PHASE 2: BUILD (120 minutes)
### Create Your AI Prompt Portfolio - Part 1

**🎯 Goal:** Students leave with 5 working AI prompts they can use IMMEDIATELY

**🎯 Psychology:** First win = confidence boost

---

### **0:45-0:55 | Setup & Handout (10 min)**

**1. Distribute Handout** (printed, one per student):

```

**3. Explain the Artifact:**
"Today you're building your first portfolio piece: **'AI Prompt Portfolio - Part 1'**

This is a simple document with 5 prompts and the AI's best responses. By the end of the day, you'll have this. You can use it immediately. You'll show it to employers: *'Here's AI I've used in real situations.'*

Not theoretical. Real."

---

### **0:55-2:45 | The Five Prompts (110 minutes)**

### **End of BUILD (2:45)**

**Collect Artifacts:**
"Everyone, save your document as: **FirstName_LastName_AIPromptPortfolio.pdf**

Upload to [LMS/Slack/Email] by end of day.

You just created your first professional AI portfolio piece. Seriously. You can put this on a resume."

---

## PHASE 3: SHOWCASE (15 minutes)
### Student Presentations & Peer Validation

**🎯 Goal:** Celebrate work, build community, validate learning

---

### **2:45-3:00 | Showcase Protocol (15 min)**

**How It Works:**
"3-4 volunteers share their BEST prompt result. 2 minutes each. Everyone else gives feedback."

**Script:**
"Who wants to share first? No judgment. Just show us what you built."

**If Volunteers Hesitate:**
"Let me go first. Here's MY best prompt result [share example]. What do you notice?"

**For Each Volunteer:**

**Student Shares (1 min):**
- "Here's the business problem I solved..."
- "Here's the prompt I wrote..."
- "Here's what AI created..."

**You Ask (20 sec):**
"What made this work?"

**Peers Respond (20 sec):**
"That's clever because..." or "I'd use that for..."

**Key to Showcase:**
- Keep energy HIGH
- Celebrate every attempt
- Normalize "AI helps humans work better"
- Ask: "Who else could use this in your job?"

---

### **Closing Message (Final 2 min)**

**Script:**
"Here's what happened today:

1. You learned what AI is (patterns from data)
2. You built 5 AI prompts that actually work
3. You created a portfolio piece
4. You shared it with each other

That's not beginner stuff. That's real skill.

**Next week:** We go deeper. We learn about the data that powers AI, and you'll understand why some AI works and some fails.

For now: **Keep that portfolio document.** Show it to friends. Use those prompts at work or in school. You're already an AI user. Next, you'll be an AI strategist.

Questions?"

## DURING SESSION: TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Student can't access ChatGPT/Claude | Have backup laptop ready; use assistant's account |
| WiFi drops | Use mobile hotspot; continue on phone |
| Student says "I don't understand AI" | Tell them: "That's okay. Everyone starts here. Just follow the prompt." |
| Student finishes early | Ask: "Can you make your prompt better? What would a CEO ask?" |
| Student is frustrated | Remind: "You're building real skills. It's okay to struggle." |
| Group is way behind | Skip Prompt 5; they have 4. Better to complete than rush. |
| Student wants to dive deep technically | "Great question. Bookmark it. We'll go deep Week 2. Today, we build confidence." |

## INSTRUCTOR MINDSET (Read This Before You Teach)

**Your Goal Is NOT:**
- ❌ Making them AI experts
- ❌ Teaching them to code
- ❌ Impressing them with technical knowledge

**Your Goal IS:**
- ✅ Showing them they can work with AI TODAY
- ✅ Building confidence in 3 hours
- ✅ Creating first portfolio piece
- ✅ Making AI feel approachable, not intimidating
- ✅ Setting tone: "You belong here"

**Remember:**
These are 17-24 year-olds, many from underrepresented backgrounds. Many have heard "you're not technical" before. 

Your job is to prove them wrong in 3 hours.

**Be the person who says:** "You can do this. And I'll help you figure it out."

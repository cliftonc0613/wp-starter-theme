## INSTRUCTOR MOVES (What to Do During BUILD)

**Every 10 minutes:**
- [ ] Walk around room
- [ ] Ask: "How's it going?"
- [ ] Look for "yellow flags" (stuck, frustrated)
- [ ] High-five completions

**For Stuck Students:**
- "What's the problem you're trying to solve?"
- "What would you want AI to help with?"
- "Copy the prompt exactly, then press enter"

**For Advanced Students:**
- "Can you make the prompt more specific?"
- "What if you asked it a follow-up question?"
- "Try a different angle—what else could this solve?"

**For Whole Group (If Many Struggle Same Thing):**
- "Everyone, pause. I'm seeing a pattern. Here's the fix..."
- Then continue.

---

## RED FLAGS (What to Watch For)

🚩 **Student disconnected/quiet**
→ Check in: "How's it going?" 
→ Sometimes they just need permission to ask for help

🚩 **Student says "I'm not technical"**
→ Respond: "None of us were. You're learning. Watch." 
→ Show them they already used AI (Netflix, Spotify, etc.)

🚩 **Group way behind (only 3 prompts done at 2:30)**
→ Skip Prompt 5
→ Better to complete 4 well than rush 5

🚩 **WiFi drops for multiple students**
→ Pivot: "Use my phone hotspot. Or work in pairs on one laptop"
→ Adapt. Don't stop.

🚩 **Student finishes early**
→ "Make your response even better. What would a CEO ask?"
→ Ask them to help another student

---

## SHOWCASE STRATEGY (Last 15 Min)

**Goal:** Celebrate, validate, build community

**If volunteers don't raise hands:**
"I'll go first. Here's my best customer email response. What do you notice?"

**For each volunteer:**
- Let them talk (1 min)
- You ask: "What made this work?" (20 sec)
- Peers respond: "That's clever..." (20 sec)

**Your closing:**
"You learned what AI is. You built 5 real prompts. You made a portfolio piece. That's advanced work. Well done."

---

## TECH BACKUP PLAN

**If ChatGPT/Claude down:**
→ Use Gemini (gemini.google.com) or Copilot

**If all internet down:**
→ Pre-demo all 5 responses (you did them yesterday, right?)
→ Show slides with AI responses
→ Students still see what AI can do

**If student's laptop dies:**
→ Pair them with partner
→ They take turns on one laptop

---

## VIBE CHECK (Read This Right Before Class Starts)

**You are:**
- Enthusiastic (AI is exciting, show it)
- Encouraging (they can do this)
- Real (not corporate, not fake)
- Available (not lecturing from podium, walking around)
- Patient (first time for many)

**You are NOT:**
- Trying to be the smartest person
- Impatient with questions
- Talking down to them
- Making it harder than it is

**Remember:** You're not teaching AI experts. You're building confidence in 3 hours. That's your real job.

## BACKUP OPENING (If Energy is Low)

"Hands up: Who's used AI before?" 
[get hands up]

"Okay, so you've used AI. You might not have realized it. When Netflix recommends a show? AI. When Spotify suggests a song? AI. When your phone keyboard predicts what you type? AI."

"Here's the thing: You've already been working with AI. Today, we're going to get intentional about it. We're going to COMMAND AI. Not just use it."

"By end of today, you'll have built something you can show employers. Ready?"

---

## BACKUP CLOSING (If Energy Fades at End)

"I know it's late. You're probably tired. But look at what you just did."

"In 3 hours, you went from 'I'm not sure about AI' to 'I built actual prompts that work.'"

"That's not beginner work. That's a skill employers pay for."

"Take your portfolio home. Show someone. Use those prompts. You earned this."

"Next session, we go deeper. But you've already won today."

## [Section 1: Core Content]

### New Concept Introduction

Building on what you know about [previous concept]:

![Connecting concepts diagram](images/sessionX-concept-connection.png)

**Previous Understanding:**
* What you already know

**New Layer:**
* How this extends/deepens it

### Detailed Explanation

Core concept for today's session.

```python
# Code example showing new concept
# that builds on previous sessions

from session_2 import previous_skill

def new_skill(data):
    """
    This combines what we learned in Session 2
    with today's new technique
    """
    # Use previous knowledge
    prepared = previous_skill(data)

    # Apply new technique
    enhanced = new_method(prepared)

    return enhanced
```

## [Section 2: Practical Application]

### Connecting to Previous Projects

Recall the project from Session Y:

```python
# Your previous code
previous_project()
```

Now we can enhance it:

```python
# Enhanced version with today's learning
def enhanced_project():
    base = previous_project()
    improved = apply_new_skill(base)
    return improved
```

### Progressive Complexity

#### Level 1: Basic (Review)
What you've already mastered:

```python
# Previous session approach
basic_solution()
```

#### Level 2: Intermediate (Today)
Adding today's techniques:

```python
# Today's enhanced approach
intermediate_solution()
```

#### Level 3: Advanced (Preview)
Where we're heading next:

```python
# Coming in Session X+1
advanced_solution()
```
